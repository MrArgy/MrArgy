[In Crish's Universe](https://gamebanana.com/mods/538894): There is one artist named Alex Crish. The whole mod is based on his creation.

Vs Argy V1: One day, BF and GF were walking in the park and BF wanted to eat ice cream. They went to the nearest ice cream van, where the line consisted of Argy and his friends. BF decided to battle with Argy so that he wouldn't be sad and called him. Argy turned to them but a microphone immediately flew into his face. Argy didn't appreciate such a joke but agreed to the rapbattle.
